- 👋 Hi, I’m @0xparks,  I have been working as a Python developer for the past 5 years. 
- 👀 I truly enjoy working with Python and its various libraries and frameworks.
- 🌱 To me, Python is a very readable, versatile language that allows me to be productive and focus my time on project goals rather than syntax details. 
- 💞️ I mainly focus on building backend web applications and APIs using Python libraries like Flask and Django.
- 💞️ I also use Python for data analysis, automation, and scripting tasks.
- 💞️ In my free time I work on small side projects where I can learn and apply new Python frameworks.
- 💞️ My main goal is to help organizations achieve their technical objectives through Python development that is maintainable, scalable and follows best practices.
- 💞️ I aim to write clean, well-documented code that is a pleasure for other developers to maintain in the future.
- 💞️ While software development is my main passion, I also value collaboration, transparency and communication within any team I work with.
- 📫 Reach out to me ...
